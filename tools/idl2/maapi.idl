/** \file maapi.h
* \brief Syscall declarations. These system calls and low-level 
* functions provide access to the basic features of a device. They are
* implemented by the MoSync runtimes in code native to the device.
*


* With these syscalls it should be possible to do most things, although,
* there may still be some functionality missing. If you
* would like a specific function added, please send us a
* <a href="mailto:info@mobilesorcery.com">mail</a>.

* In future versions of MoSync an extension API will be provided
* that will allow you to create your own custom syscalls.


* Some Caveats:
*

* The Runtime expects alignment rules to be followed.
* Writing or reading to unaligned memory will cause a MoSync Panic.

* Some functions may also cause a panic if they are passed incorrect parameters.
* A complete reference of these panics can be found <a href="../panics.html">here</a>.

* The codepage for functions that use strings is platform-dependent beyond 7-bit ASCII.
* Most use Latin-1, but you should still be wary.


* Additional notes:


* There are different types of handles: Connection, Store and Resource.
* They are all represented as positive signed integers.
* When a handle is passed to a function, it must have the proper type.

* Each MoSync program has a Resource array. It is acccessed and manipulated by certain
*  syscalls, but it cannot be accessed directly.
* Each resource (aka Object) is represented by a
* handle. There are different types of resources, for example
* Image, Binary data, Sound or Placeholder. A placeholder object is not a real object, but
* just a handle which you can use to construct new objects dynamically.
* Resources can also be defined at compile time, by using MoSync's resource compiler.
* Placeholders can either be defined at compile time using a resource compiler directive
* or created dynamically at runtime using maCreatePlaceholder().
* See the tutorials, examples and the resource compiler reference documentation for more
* information.

* There is an event queue which contains keypad events and results from asynchronous operations.
* Use maWait() and maGetEvent() to handle it.

* There are different types of connection operations.
* For each connection, only one of each type of operation may be active at the same time.

	* <tt>ssl</tt>, which is an encrypted TCP connection. It has no parameters.
	*
	* <tt>http</tt>, which is HTTP/1.0 GET. When using HTTP, you need not specify the port;
	* it defaults to port 80.
	*
	* Its parameters is the document path (for example, "/index.html").
	* You must specify a path, or this function will fail with #CONNERR_URL.
	* The minimal path ("/") is acceptable.
	*
	* Writing to a http connection is not allowed.
	*
	* <tt>https</tt>, which is an encrypted HTTP GET. It has the same parameters as <tt>http</tt>.
	*
	* <tt>btspp</tt>, which is Bluetooth Serial Port. It has no parameters.
	*\n
	*\n
	* For the <tt>socket</tt> and <tt>http</tt> protocols, \a \<address\> can be either a decimal,
	* dot-delimited (.) IPv4 address or a standard Domain Name,
	* while \a \<port\> is a decimal number from 1 to 65535.
	*
	* In the <tt>socket</tt> protocol, certain ports are protected on certain platforms and
	* cannot be used, most notably port 80 on Java ME. In this case, use http instead.
	*
	* On a few devices, using ports numbered below 1024 may cause system crashes.
	* Therefore, it is advisable to use ports above 1024 if you can choose.
	*
	* On some J2ME devices, connections to port 443 (except from https) is not
	* allowed and might cause a system exception.
	*
	* For the <tt>btspp</tt> protocol, \a \<address\> is 12 hexadecimal digits and
	* \<port\> is a decimal number from 1 to 30.
	*
	* Example TCP url: <tt>socket://www.example.com:23</tt>
	*
	* Example SSL url: <tt>ssl://www.example.com:22</tt>
	*
	* Example HTTP url: <tt>http://www.example.com/directory/document.html</tt>
	*
	* Example HTTPS url: <tt>https://www.example.com/directory/document.html</tt>
	*
	* Example Bluetooth url: <tt>btspp://001dbe15e455:9</tt>
	*
	* You can also use MAUtil::BluetoothConnection to connect via Bluetooth service uuid.
	*
	* To find useful Bluetooth addresses, use the Bluetooth discovery API.
	* See maBtStartDeviceDiscovery().
	*
	*
	* The result of the operation will be delivered in a CONN event, with
	* MAConnEventData::opType set to #CONNOP_CONNECT.
	*
	* The success value is \> 0. For the <tt>http</tt> protocol,
	* the success value is the HTTP response code.
	*
	*
	* When you're done with the connection, maConnClose() must be called to free
	* the resources associated with the handle. This must be done even if
	* the connect operation failed.
	*
	* There is a limit of #CONN_MAX open connection handles at any time, so if you keep
	* opening connections without closing them, you'll eventually receive the
	* #CONNERR_MAX error code instead of new connection handles.
	*
	* Alternatively, this function can be called with one of these url types to
	* create a Server Connection:\n
	* <tt>socket://[:\<port\>]</tt>, for TCP.\n
	* <tt>btspp://localhost:\<uuid\>[;name=\<YourServiceName\>]</tt>, for Bluetooth.\n
	* \<uuid\> is a 32-digit hexadecimal number. It will be used to create the
	* service record. Its MAUUID representation can be used by clients to search for
	* this service.
	*
	* Example Bluetooth server url:
	* <tt>btspp://localhost:0000110100001000800000805F9B34FB;name=Serial Port</tt>
	*
	* Server connections are created synchronously; no CONN event is generated,
	* and as soon as this function returns, it's done.
	*
	* A server connection can not be read from or written to, but it can be closed.
	* You can also use it in calls to maAccept() and maConnGetAddr().
