<h1>Bitmap Font Generator - Documentation</h1>

<p>The Bitmap Font Generator is a free program to generate bitmap fonts from true type fonts. 
The bitmaps are generated in such a way as to leave as little unused space as possible. The
position of the characters in the bitmap is not regular so you'll need the generated font
descriptor file to determine how to draw each character.</p>

<h2>Font settings</h2>

<p><img src="doc/font_settings.png"></p>

<p>You can open the font settings dialog by going to the Options menu and choosing Font 
settings, or you can just press F on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The left half of this dialog controls the properties of the font, i.e. the character
set, and looks. The right half controls how the font will be stored, i.e. texture layout, 
file format, etc. The left half is pretty self explanatory, so I'll explain only the 
right half.</p>

<h3>Padding</h3>

<p>Padding is useful when you want to add some post processing effects in another 
paint program. For example, if you want to add a blurring effect that uses a 5x5 kernel,
you would add a padding of 2 on all sides. Similarly if you want to add a drop shadow, you
would add a bit of padding below and to the right of the characters (assuming that's the 
direction of the drop shadow that you want).

<h3>Spacing</h3>

<p>The spacing controls how much minimum space is left between characters in the font 
texture. If you're using mipmapping to scale the font texture when drawing the font, you'll 
need to add spacing to avoid bleeding when the texture is downscaled. The more mipmap levels
you use the more spacing you need.</p>

<p>Bilinear filtering may also cause bleeding, so unless you use pixel perfect drawing, where
each texel is perfectly mapped to a pixel on the screen with a 1-to-1 releation ship you'll
want to use at least 1 for vertical and horizontal spacing.</p>

<h3>Texture</h3>

<p>BMFont supports several different texture layouts. The width and height, of course control
the size of the texture. You'll want to keep the texture as small as possible, while 
still allowing all characters to fit in one texture.</p>

<p>If you're importing colored icons, or planning on using post processing to add colors to the
characters, then you'll want to choose the 32bit format, otherwise the 8bit format may be sufficient.</p>

<p>If you choose the 32bit format, you may still optimize the usage of the texture memory if you
choose to pack characters in each channel, though that will require a special <a href="#shader">pixel shader</a> to 
decode during drawing. In this mode you can still import colored icons, the characters will be
properly packed around them.</p>

<p>The font outline can also be encoded together with the character in 8 bits, allowing you to
store many more characters in the same space than if you had stored the outlined characters as
colored images. This too require a special <a href="#shader">pixel shader</a> to 
decode during drawing.</p>

<h3>File format</h3>

<p>Finally you can choose the file format for both the font descriptor and textures. This is mostly
a matter of choice, rather than one having more benefits than the other. Though if you want to save
disc space, you may want to choose binary file descriptor with png textures.</p>

<h2>Command line parameters</h2>

<p>The application can be used from the command line, to performed automated generation of font files. The 
prerequisite is a font configuration file, that you can save from the application, or even generate yourself. 
The command line parameters are:</p>

<ul>
<li>-c fontconfig.bmfc : Names the configuration file with the options for generating the font.
<li>-o outputfile.fnt : Names of the output font file.
<li>-t textfile.txt : Optional argument that names a text file. All characters present in the text file will be 
added to the font.
</ul>

<h2>Binary file layout</h2>

<p>This section describes the layout of the tags in the binary file format. To understand what each tag means refer 
to the <a href="#tags">file tags</A> section.</p>

<p>The first three bytes are the file identifier and must always be 66, 77, 70, or "BMF". The fourth byte gives 
the format version, currently it must be the binary 1 or 2. Version 2 sees the addition of outline in the 
infoBlock and encoded in the commonBlock.</p>

<p>Following the first four bytes is a series of blocks with information. Each block starts with a one byte block 
type identifier, followed by a 4 byte integer that gives the size of the block, including the 4 byte size value, 
but not the block type identifier.</p>

<h3>Block type 1: info</h3>

<pre>
#pragma pack(1)
struct infoBlock
{
    int  blockSize;
    WORD fontSize;
    BYTE reserved:4;
    BYTE bold    :1;
    BYTE italic  :1;
    BYTE unicode :1;
    BYTE smooth  :1;
    BYTE charSet;
    WORD stretchH;
    BYTE aa;
    BYTE paddingUp;
    BYTE paddingRight;
    BYTE paddingDown;
    BYTE paddingLeft;
    BYTE spacingHoriz;
    BYTE spacingVert;
    BYTE outline;         // Added with version 2
    char fontName[1];
};
</pre>

<p>This structure gives the layout of the fields. Remember that there should be no 
padding between members. Allocate the size of the block using the blockSize, as 
following the block comes the font name, including the terminating null char. 
Most of the time this block can simply be ignored.</p>

<h3>Block type 2: common</h3>

<pre>
#pragma pack(1)
struct commonBlock
{
    int  blockSize;
    WORD lineHeight;
    WORD base;
    WORD scaleW;
    WORD scaleH;
    WORD pages;
    BYTE packed  :1;
    BYTE encoded :1;      // Added with version 2
    BYTE reserved:6;
}; 
</pre>

<h3>Block type 3: pages</h3>

<pre>
#pragma pack(1)
struct pagesBlock
{
    int  blockSize;
    char pageNames[1];
};
</pre>

<p>This block gives the name of each texture file with the image data for the characters. 
The string pageNames holds the names separated and terminated by null chars. Each filename 
has the same length, so once you know the size of the first name, you can easily determine 
the position of each of the names. The id of each page is the zero-based index of the string name.</p>

<h3>Block type 4: chars</h3>

<pre>
#pragma pack(1)
struct charsBlock
{
    int blockSize;
    struct charInfo
    {
        WORD  id;
        WORD  x;
        WORD  y;
        WORD  width;
        WORD  height;
        short xoffset;
        short yoffset;
        short xadvance;
        BYTE  page;
        BYTE  chnl;
    } chars[1];
};
</pre>

<p>The number of characters in the file can be computed by taking the size of the block 
and dividing with the size of the charInfo structure, i.e.:  numChars = (charsBlock.blockSize - 4)/18.</p>

<h3>Block type 5: kerning pairs</h3>

<pre>
#pragma pack(1)
struct kerningPairsBlock
{
    int blockSize;
    struct kerningPair
    {
        WORD  first;
        WORD  second;
        short amount;
    } kerningPairs[1];
};
</pre>

<p>This block is only in the file if there are any kerning pairs with amount differing from 0.</p>

<h2>Pixel shader sample</h2>

<p>This pixel shader shows how to decode the color from a font texture with characters packed 
into all 4 channels, and each channel using special encoding to store the character with the 
outline. The texture is also allowed to store full 32bit images for some characters.</p>

<pre>
// DirectX 9 pixel shader
float4 PixScene( float4 color : COLOR0,
                 int4   chnl  : TEXCOORD1,
                 float2 tex0  : TEXCOORD0 ) : COLOR0
{
  float4 pixel = tex2D(g_samScene, tex0);
    
  if( dot(vector(1,1,1,1), chnl) )
  {
    float val = dot(pixel, chnl);
		
    pixel.rgb = val > 0.5 ? 2*val-1 : 0;
    pixel.a   = val > 0.5 ? 1 : 2*val;
  }
    
  return pixel * color;
}
</pre>

<p>The chnl texture coordinate is a 4D vector that shows which channel the character should be read 
from. If this is (0,0,0,0) the character is interpreted as a 32 bit image. The texture coordinate 
can be stored in a UBYTE4 type, so it doesn't require much bandwidth when being sent to the video card.</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<h3>Cropped characters</h3>

<p>With some fonts, some characters are cropped. An example is Bitstream's Cyberbit font, where the bottom of the 
square bracket characters are cropped off in some font sizes.</p>

<p>This is a compatibility problem between the font and GDI, not a problem in this application by itself. You get 
the same problem in WordPad for example. I will however try out other font rasterizers, to see if I can fix this 
problem in a future version.</p>

<h3>Characters are disabled, yet they have images</h3>

<p>Depending on your Windows configuration you may see that with some fonts characters are disabled, yet have a 
character image. Especially with the asian character sets. This is because Windows automatically fills in the 
missing characters by taking them from another font when the international language pack is installed.</p>

<p>I do not consider this an error in BMFont, but it may be fixed in a future version, especially if I end up using 
another font rasterizer.</p>

<h3>Rotated characters</h3>

<p>Some font files have some but not all subsets with characters rotated by 90 degrees. For example @Arial Unicode MS, 
with subset Enclosed Alphanumerics. This is not an error, but a feature of that font file. With the font rotated 
like this it permits writing texts in normal text editors as if they were in vertical lines.</p>
