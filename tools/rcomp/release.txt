plug-in now sets the PATH before invoking the command line tools.


1)	William
	1)	Fixed defect ROS-55KJ4U "RCOMP fails if epoc32\tools not on the path"


Version 7.00
============

Released by David Batchelor (November/December 2001)

The format of resource files changes as follows:

- The initial 2 two-byte values are removed as they are completely redundant. (All the information
  they provide can be derived from the last 2 bytes of the file combined with the size of the
  file.)
- Resource files now have a standard 4-byte checked-UID field at the start. The first UID is
  0x101f4a6b, to indicate that the resource file potentially contains Unicode compressed according
  to the "Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode" (see
  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6/tr6-3.2.html). The second and third UIDs may be
  specified on the command-line by using an optional parameter of the form
  "-{0x12345678,0x9abcdef0}" (without the quotation marks). If "*" is used as the last UID, e.g.
  "-{0x600ddea1,*}", then the resource file's "offset" (i.e. the 20-bit number generated from the
  resource file's "NAME") is used as the last UID.
- The UID field is immediately followed by a bit-array, one bit for each resource in the resource
  file, where each bit indicates whether the corresponding resource contains compressed Unicode.
  The bit field is padded up to a multiple of 8-bits (if necessary) with zero bits.
- Each resource which contains compressed Unicode consists of a series of "runs" preceded by a 1
  or 2-byte run-length (1 byte if the run is <128 bytes, else 2 bytes). The run-length value does
  not include itself in the byte count that it holds. The first run, the third run, the fifth run
  etc contain compressed Unicode. The second run, the fourth run, the sixth run etc contain other
  stuff. As the protocol defines that the first run is compressed Unicode, this run may obviously
  be of zero length - no subsequent run in that resource may be of zero length.
- Rcomp only uses compressed Unicode for text fields if it yields any benefit (i.e. only if it
  actually makes the output file smaller).
- The changes are completely transparent for code that reads resources.


Version 6.03
============

Released by William Roberts, 30-Jul-2001

Fix defect EXT-4YSCUV "Resource compiler corrupts long strings"
Handle very long C++ comments, which previously caused a "token buffer overflow" message from the
lexical analyser. Avoid overruning the buffer for literals by using a CHECK_APPEND() macro which
discards characters rather than run off the end, giving errors like

<empty>(5) : string too long - 1 ignored
<empty>(5) : string too long - 2 ignored

Avoid overflowing the Value array in string expressions by checking the new length before
agreeing to concatenate the strings. Ultimately it would be best to replace Value[] with 
a char* which has been created with strdup() and can therefore be realloc'd to grow the string.

Fix defect ARG-4TZF7J "RCOMP needs warning waivers registered with SI"
Removed all warnings in tools rel build - some tools deb warnings will appear in rcomp.cpp 
because of problems in the mks\etc\yyparse.cpp file, but I didn't want to hide related problems 
in any new Symbian code we might add. 

Improve the -v output to show the primitive types being emitted, and to dump the IndexTable as hex
offsets followed by the resource name, e.g.

    IndexTable
    IndexTableItem 4	<empty>
    IndexTableItem c	r_eikserv_panic_dialog
    IndexTableItem b8	r_eiksrv_oom_event_top
    IndexTableItem e4	r_eiksrv_oom_event_bot
    IndexTableItem 144	r_eikserv_replace_main_batteries
    IndexTableItem 170	r_eikserv_replace_backup_battery

and 

    ResourceHeader          r_eiksrv_tasklist_dialog
    ++ResourceItemArray
    SimpleResourceItem [Long flags]  9
    SimpleResourceItem [LText16 title]  
    SimpleResourceItem [LLink pages]  
    SimpleResourceItem [LLink buttons]  
    StructArrayResourceItem (Level 0) [items]  
    ArrayLength [Word] 1
    ----------------------
    --ResourceItemArrayArray
    ++ResourceItemArray
    SimpleResourceItem [Word type]  1001
    SimpleResourceItem [LText16 prompt]  
    SimpleResourceItem [Word id]  1
    SimpleResourceItem [Long itemflags]  0
    StructTypeResourceItem (Level 0) [control]  
    ----------------------
    ++ResourceItemArray
    SimpleResourceItem [Byte version]  0
    SimpleResourceItem [Word flags]  0
    SimpleResourceItem [Word height]  8
    SimpleResourceItem [Word width]  20
    SimpleResourceItem [LLink array_id]  
    ----------------------
    SimpleResourceItem [LText16 trailer]  
    ----------------------

Together these changes should make it significantly easier to step through the binary image of a
resource and work out which element has changed unexpectedly.


Version 6.02
============

Released by William Roberts, 15-Feb-2001

Fix awful defect in version 6.01, which caused negative integer constants to be written to the file as -1.

When testing with LOCKIT, RCOMP developer should be aware that the version of RCOMP.EXE used by lockit 
is kept in \lockit\tools, not \epoc32\tools.


Version 6.01
============

Released by William Roberts, 14-Feb-2001

Redefined character literals ('x') to be effectively strings so that they can contain UTF8 encodings
for interesting characters. This is handled using the same lexical rules as string literals, so
the limited escape processing is also supported. The introduction of strings surrounded by single-quotes
means that the sequence \' is now accepted as standing for '.

If the character literal string decodes to more than one Unicode character, a warning is given and the
rest of the string is ignored. The prevailing source character encoding is used, but there is no support
narrow character literals in the difficult part of the CP1252 range: the interpretation of the literal
is always "the Unicode encoding for the first character of the string". For example, even in a 
CP1252 source file building a narrow resource, a literal containing the Euro symbol will be interpreted 
as 0x20ac, not 0x80.

LTEXT strings are now checked to ensure that they are less than 256 characters in length.

The NAME statement can now take a string literal or a label, instead of the previous behaviour where the
lexical analyser handled the following word differently. Any RSS file which used a keyword as a name,
for example WORD.RSS, will need to be changed to specify the name as a literal: the preferred syntax
is to use string literals in all cases.


Version 3.18
============

Released by William Roberts, 05-Aug-1999.

Requires BAFL 092.

Changed the handling of Unicode string resources (TEXT16 and LTEXT16) to ensure that the
Unicode characters are aligned to a multiple of 2 bytes when the resource is used.
 
Resources are never used in place: instead RResourceFile::AllocReadLC creates an HBufC8 to hold a
copy of the data. This means that rather than aligning from the start of the entire resource file,
instead we have to align to the start of the individual resource, because the data in an HBufC8 
always starts at an aligned address.

Added RCBinaryStream::Align(int nBytes) and RCBinaryStream::SetAlignBase() to support the 
generation of the necessary padding, and call them from suitable places in RCOSTRM.CPP.

Also added code to add 1 to the offset of the end of the table of resource offsets: this is tested
in BAFL as a marker to indicate the new format of resource file.

Added a /verbose flag to core.cmd which invokes RCOMP with -v.

Added #pragma warning( disable : 4710 ) in a couple of places to cut down on the number of
unnecessary and useless "warnings".

Regenerated the test resources.


Version 3.17
============

Released by William Roberts, 25-Jun-1999.

Fixed defect where embedded Unicode characters could cause BUF<x> strings to fail a length check.
Updated test code include a check for this.

Added more stuff for the Engineering Automated Build.


Version 3.16
============

Released by Pute, 9-Jun-1999.  Based on work by William Roberts,
26-May-1999 described in the "William's notes" section below.


Character sets
--------------

We are moving towards a specific principle of character sets for RCOMP.

Previously, the character set used by RCOMP was not well defined, later we
added the CHARACTER_SET identifier.  This implied that any specific values
inserted into strings in <n> format would be in the character set of the
source.

In this design RCOMP will have trouble handling multibyte encodings like
Shift-JIS because the tools it relies upon, LEX and YACC, are based on
single-octet encodings only. Sometimes a multibyte encoding will produce
artefacts that appear to be syntax elements such as double quote marks.

In future the intention is that RCOMP uses UTF-8 encoding internally,
provided by a pre-processing phase.  This release is an interim step.

In this release, when explicit values are inserted in text strings, they
are interpreted as Unicode values and converted to UTF-8.  To retain
backward compatibility with CP1252 source, values 80-9F are also permitted
and these will be mapped to Unicode as before when the source character set
is defined to be CP1252.  The use of explicit values 80-9F is deprecated
however.

The default input character set is CP1252.  Previously, the default
character set was "unknown".  This possibility is no-longer supported.
This was also contrary to documentation.


Details:

Test command procedure updated and enhanced.

Test comparison files TUTEXT8.RSC and TUTEXT16.RSC have been updated to
allow for the introduction of the extra characters in the CP1252 character
set.  (128 used to be "not used" and is now the euro sign)

Note that compilation warning messages about deprecated characters will
appear durng this test.

A new test source file TWTEXT.RSS and associated reference binaries have
been added to the test suite to demonstrate explicit use of values >255.




William's notes (edited by Pute):
---------------

Defined a new "character set" called UTF8, which supports the UTF8
encoding of Unicode strings. 
This actually allows the whole resource source file to be entered as
UTF8 if required.  However the default charset remains CP1252.

Arranged to support embedded Unicode characters constructed using the
<xxx> notation, to support the use of 0x07ED as the end-of-paragraph
marker (see ETEXT 120). This exploits the UTF8 support by inserting the
appropriate UTF8 sequence into the 8-bit data.

The embedded Unicode characters are also supported in the CP1252
character set, with internal use of 0x81 as an "escape" character
indicating that the following bytes are a UTF8 encoded character. This
allows existing CP1252 resource source files to be used with the new
ETEXT.

Added the Euro and the Z caron encodings to the cp1252_exceptions table.


Only RCOMP.EXE has been rebuilt.  Judging from the timestamps, the other
executables haven't been rebuilt for the last few releases.

To build rcomp, first run ..\src\BLDEX, then MNT BLDREL

Building is only possible from NT and makes use of lex and yacc from
T:\mks - this should be updated to use the GNUPro tools which we use to
build GCC, as the Cygnus toolchain is something we expect to have always
available.



Version 3.15
============

Released by SimonC, 01-Feb-1999

Fixed defects
	EDN484092 "RCOMP needs to be Symbianised"
	EDN584421 "Need to rebuild RCOMP with boilerplated headers"

Only RCOMP.EXE has been rebuilt.  Judging from the timestamps, the other executables
haven't been rebuilt for the last few releases.

To build rcomp, first run ..\src\BLDEX, then MNT BLDREL

Building is only possible from the NT and makes use of executables on T: so this can't
be rebuilt by licensees (which doesn't seem to have been a problem so far...)



Version 3.14
============

Released by PNJ, 19-Mar-1997

The CORE command and the test procedures rely on NT command extensions.


Version 314 mods

  1. In FILELINE.CPP, FileLineManager::ExtractFileName updated to add
     filename information planted by the preprocessor. This is a rewrite of
     the code that was removed in the previous release because it was
     violating.
  2. Test code now in a formalised framework accessed via MNT TEST. The
     formalism isn't perfect because of the limitations imposed by the
     legacy command language. See TEST.HTM in the TSRC directory for more
     information. The test procedure relies on NT command extensions.
  3. The CORE command procedure has been changed to allow preprocessor
     symbols to be defined. See below.

CORE syntax

CORE filename [ object_directory [options] ]

If options are being used the object directory parameter must be present,
the default value is "." for the current directory.

Options are:

/UNICODE
     Specifies that strings are emitted as Unicode in the resource binary.
     Previously, this option was selected with "-u", which is the parameter
     currently used by RCOMP itself.
/DEFINE symbol [ symbol...]
     Specifies one or more symbols to be defined for the preprocessor pass.
     This must be the last option supplied because it is followed by an
     arbitrary number of tokens and the command language is so primitive.








Version 3.13
============

Released by PNJ, 13-Jan-1997

Version number scheme is independent of product-specific E32 chain
numbering.

This is an interim release, to provide 16-bit character set functionality.
Later releases are planned to provide other requested features.  Existing
RSS files produce identical binaries to previous releases when compiled
in the default non-Unicode mode.

There are some serious defects in the source code which will take
a long time to address properly, eg misuse of assert as a status check.

1.  Minor changes to MNT and build settings.
2.  Minor code changes to remove warnings.
3.  Renamed STRING.CPP, .H to remove ambiguity with
    standard header of the same name.
4.  rcscan::yyerror function updated so that it actually
    interprets formatted strings instead of ignoring the extra
    parameters.
5.  Fixed defect in String operator != which was doing the inverse
    of what it is supposed to do!
6.  Provide a qualifier for Unicode output.
7.  Fix erroneous error message if source file not specified.
8.  Fixed problem which caused run time fatal errors during
    source context switching.
9.  Introduce new tokens to differentiate between 8 and 16-bit
    text strings.
10. Introduce a CHARACTER_SET token to specify the source
    character set.
11. Introduce an extra test component directory.
12. Introduce a command procedure wrapper for RCOMP (called CoRe)


Language features
-----------------

CHARACTER_SET name

Specifies the character set of the input file.  The implementation currently
does not do much with this, but will do in the nexty release or 2.  Legal
values for name are currently:

ASCII, CP1252, CP850, ISOLatin1, ShiftJIS, Unicode

Note that Unicode source text is not likely to be supported any time soon,
largely because RCOMP relies on LEX and YACC which are not Unicode-aware.

The default setting in this implementation is CP1252.


TEXT, LTEXT and BUF

Now have explicit 8 and 16-bit variants, eg TEXT8, BUF16.  The unadorned
variants are internally converted to the 8 or 16-bit equivalents depending
on the presence of the -u (for unicode) command line qualifier.

The prefixed counter for an LTEXT16 is still an 8-bit field.

The zero terminator for a TEXT16 is a 16-bit field.

For text fields, it is recommended that you continue to use the unadorned
keywords. For binary data, you should use the explicit 8-bit keywords. This
is likely to apply most commonly to the BUF (BUF8) keyword.





Version 0.03.12
===============

1) Reduced verbosity.
2) Released a version compatible with NT4.

Version 0.03.11
===============

1) PVCS'ed RCOMP and generally tidied it up.
2) Fixed empty BUF crash.
3) Fixed extra trailing comma crash.
4) Cleaned up the build warnings.
5) Added ...BUF<n>... where n is an integer giving max length of BUF.
6) The .exe is now called rcomp.exe.

Version 3.06, MartinW, 05 Jul 96
================================
1. Added enum handling.
        e.g.
        ENUM ExampleEnum { Elem1, Elem2}
        STRUCT a { BYTE b;}
        RESOURCE a c { b = ExampleEnum::Elem2;}
This should set up b with the value 1.

Version 3.05, MartinW, 30 May 96
================================
1.Deal with long (>42characters) resource names in output to header
  file.
2.Prevent assertion failure in case of missing comma after first item
  in an array of struct's.

Version 3.04, MartinW, 29 Apr 96
================================
Avoid using cin by reading from a specified file (-s<filename>). The 
cin approach suffered from something to do with the source file being 
left open even when the program ended. This was the case at least with 
a test program built using C++ 1.51 and run under NT 3.51.
e.g.    void main() { char a; cin << a; }
        TestProgram < a.src
        del a.src             <---- "file in use by another process".

Version 3.03, MartinW, 18 Apr 96
================================
1.Handle syntax error with numbers more effectively so assert does not
  fail.
2.Accept 0 for double without warning.

Version 3.02, MartinW, 11 Apr 96
================================
Corrected defect to do with line number in error message for text being
converted to a number.

Version 3.01, MartinW, 9 Apr 96
===============================
1.I added more error handling so that more proper error messages are
  given.
2.I altered the error message format so that it is suitable for VC++.
  Brief seems to cope with this new format quite happily. VC++ didn't 
  seem to like e.g. ".\t1.rss" at the start but "C:\rcomp\src\t1.rss" 
  worked.
3.The drive and directory for the file name specified with -i is used
  to provide the full paths for all filenames given in error messages. 
  If the -i file name is not a full path then the current directory and 
  drive are used in combination with the partial path to create a full 
  path.

Version 3.00, MartinW, 19 Mar 96
================================
To use this resource compiler execute "mnt getrel". The egrs.bat file
is an example of how the resource compiler may be run. The GNU
preprocessor is used (t:\tools\gnucpp.exe) first and the output
passed to rc3.exe. The fc4bat.exe file is used to avoid writing the
header output file if it has in fact not changed.

Details about this version
--------------------------
This is a completely new version based on yacc and lex along with C++.

Overview of system:
        Source file (e.g.pic.rss) 
                -> Preprocessing
                -> Lexer
                -> Parser
                -> Data structures (using C++ classes)
                -> Data file output (e.g. pic.rsg)
                -> Header file output (e.g. pic.h)

        The GNU C++ preprocessor was used. The output from this
        includes directives giving line numbering following inclusion
        of header files. The lexer uses this to store data which the 
        parser then uses to output error messages in Brief format.
    
        The lexer and parser are generated by lex and yacc
        respectively from rcomp.l and rcomp.y. These define the
        tokens and the grammar for the resource script language.

        Supporting C++ classes are compiled and linked along with the
        output from lex and yacc.

        The batch file rs.bat takes the file specified by the first
        parameter and passes it to the GNU preprocessor. The output
        is piped through to rcomp.exe. The names of the data output 
        file and the header file are specified based on the name
        given to rs.bat. The -i flag is used to give the original
        name (as passed to the preprocessor) for error reporting.
     
        A program called fc4bat.exe is used to give an errorlevel if
        the specified files do not match. This is used to avoid
        changing the date on the header file if it has not changed.

Issues for porting to other platforms:
         1) atof has been used. The output of this is written to the
            rsc file. The format must be that expected by the program
            reading the rsc file rather than the format of the
            machine used to generate the file.
         2) The MKS versions of yacc and lex were used. These are PC
            versions of the UNIX tools. The non-standard features
            were avoided however only the PC versions have been used.
         3) Stream handling has been used. Apparently there may be
            differences in implementations of this extension to C++.
