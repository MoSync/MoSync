Quick Example
-------------

    // Get the data directory, creating it if it doesn't exist.
    dataDir = fileSystem.root.getDirectory("data", {create: true});

    // Create the lock file, if and only if it doesn't exist.
    lockFile = dataDir.getFile("lockfile.txt", {create: true, exclusive: true});
