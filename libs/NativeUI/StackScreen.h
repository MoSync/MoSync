     * \brief A stack screen is a special type of screen that manages navigation
     * between a set of screens.
     *
     * The screen stack can be pushed or popped. Pushing a given screen will
     * hide the current screen and display the pushed screen. Popping a screen
     * hides the current screen and shows the previous screen in the stack.
     * See push() and pop().
     * Navigation between the screens in the stack is handled according to the
     * norm on the specific platform. On iPhone a navigation bar is added to
     * each pushed screen that can be used to go back, while on Android there
     * is no extra UI added and the back button is used to go back to the
     * previous screen.
