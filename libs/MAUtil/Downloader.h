Downloader state specification
------------------------------

This diagram shows the allowed state transitions for
a downloader and its listener. When having multiple
listeners, initiation of a new download from a listener
will cause a panic (beginDownloading can only be called
if a download is not in progress).

downloader.beginDownloading ->
  precondition: closeConnection(NO_CLEANUP)
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Error
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Ok

downloader.cancelDownloading ->
  precondition: closeConnection(CLEANUP)
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Ok
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Error

listener.notifyProgress ->
  precondition: none
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Error
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Ok

listener.finishedDownloading ->
  precondition: closeConnection(NO_CLEANUP)
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Ok
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Error

listener.downloadCancelled ->
  precondition: closeConnection(CLEANUP)
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Ok
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Error

listener.error ->
  precondition: closeConnection(CLEANUP)
  downloader.beginDownloading -> Ok
  downloader.cancelDownloading -> Error
