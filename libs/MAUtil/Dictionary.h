/** \brief Thin template sorted Dictionary.
*
* The Dictionary is a data storage mechanism that stores unique values.
* The Dictionary is sorted, by a method selectable by the user.
* It has fairly fast insert, erase and lookup operations. (O(log n), specifically.)
* It has an Iterator, which allows you to access all elements in order.
*
* This particular implementation is built on top of kazlib's dictionary system,
* which makes it quite small, even when used with multiple data types.
*
* This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.
* It is the base class for Set and Map.
*
* \note It is not allowed to change the Key of an element.
* Doing so would break the sorting order of the Dictionary.
* The consequenses are undefined, and will likely cause your program to crash.
*
* If you must change a Key, erase the original element from the dictionary,
* make your change and then re-insert it.
