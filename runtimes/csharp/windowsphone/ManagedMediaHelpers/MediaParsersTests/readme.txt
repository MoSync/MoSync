Silverlight NUnit Project Template
==================================

NOTE: New references must be marked with... Copy Local: True.

This project template is designed to work with TestDriven.Net 2.13 or greater.
http://www.testdriven.net/download.aspx

To execute one or more unit tests use the 'Run Test(s)', 'Test With > Debugger'
or 'Test With > Coverage' commands. Tests will execute using the Silverlight
assemblies, but using the .NET 2.0 runtime.

Individual methods can be executed using the Silverlight 2.0/CoreCLR runtime
using the 'Test With > silverlight' command.
