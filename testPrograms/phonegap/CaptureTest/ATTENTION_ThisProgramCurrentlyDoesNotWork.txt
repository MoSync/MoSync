CaptureTest currently does not work on Android, because
the feature of creating an image handle using the capture
handle has been removed on Android.

On iOS this should still work, but plans are to redesign
and update the Capture API, and then this feature may work
in a different way.

Solution is to rewrite CaptureTest to read image from
the captured file, and then display it.
