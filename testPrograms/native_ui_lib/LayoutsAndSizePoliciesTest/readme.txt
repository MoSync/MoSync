This application creates and displays different layouts as a slide show.

It contains a main layout, a container a label and button (static for now).
The type of the container layout, its size policy, the size policy of the label and its
text size change in each "slide" thus creating an different scenario every time.

Note: There are 64 scenarios generated this time. The number might increase with future changes.

Important:
	- The screen will contain details about the displayed configuration.
	- The slide show is started by a tap on the screen (I suggest the details container to avoid
		interference with other widgets).
	- The slide show can be paused (for a better observation of the scenario) by tapping.
		To resume just tap again.
