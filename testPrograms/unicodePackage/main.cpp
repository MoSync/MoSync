* This application provides a very basic example of how to use MoSync's Moblet
* framework to detect key events and use timers. It displays the text "Hello
* Moblet!" The text can be moved around using the joystick or you can click on
* the screen and the text will jump to that position. The code is
* very well commented so that you can see what's happening at each step.

	//First, the constructor, which we will call when we need an instance
	//of MyMoblet. We set some initial values for the parameters mDirX, mDirY,
	//mX and mY which we will be using to store the direction of movement and
	//the current location. As they are member variables, they have an "m"
	//prefix; their declaration can be found in the private section of the class.

		mScreenHeight = EXTENT_Y(screenSize);

		//Call the draw() function to display the text on the screen. The draw()
		//function is defined later in this class.

	//Next, the method that gets called when a key is pressed. This is a method
	//we have inherited from the Moblet base class, and here we will override
