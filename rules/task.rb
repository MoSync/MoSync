# This is the base file for the Work system.
# Work is a library designed to help generate new files from existing source files.
# In other words, a build system.
# Work shares some similarities with <em>make</em> and <em>rake</em>,
# especially in its base structure, but have many additions.
# It's designed to be fast; minimizing the number of processes started and
# the number of file system accesses.
