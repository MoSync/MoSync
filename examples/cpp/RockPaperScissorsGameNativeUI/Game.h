 * This file contains the game logic for the game.
 *
 * Game logic:
 * The game is started by clicking the Start button, and that enables the
 * user to select a weapon from the 3 available ones.
 * The opponent's weapon is chosen randomly, and it is shown only after
 * the user has picked his weapon.
 * The game result is displayed using two strings: who won the game, and why.
 * The score info at the bottom is updated after each game is finished.
 * Game can be restarted by pressing the Start button again.
