/**
 * @file main.cpp
 *
 * This application provides a very basic example of how to use some native UI widgets.
 * It is based on the game Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 * The application makes use of MoSync's Moblet framework to handle events.
 *
 * In Moblet.cpp we manage the entire application.
 * In Playscreen.cpp we define the UI elements.
 * And in Game.cpp we handle the game logic.
 *
 * Note also that this example will not work on the MoSync emulator (MoRE)
 * because it has no Native UI support yet.
