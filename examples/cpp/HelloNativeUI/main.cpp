/**
 * @file main.cpp
 * @author Mattias Frånberg and Chris Hughes
 *
 * This application provides a very basic example of how to work
 * with Native UI to position and and manipulate graphical user
 * interface elements. The code is very well commented so that you
 * can see what's happening at each step. The application uses one
 * screen and a some widgets to provide a password entry box and
 * some control buttons.
 *
 * NOTE: This example application has the same functionality as
 * our example application "HelloMAUI". Compare the two examples
 * to see how we do similar things in MAUI and in Native UI.
