/**
 * @file hellomaui.cpp
 * @author Chris Hughes
 *
 * This application provides a very basic example of how to work
 * with MAUI to position and and manipulate graphical user interface
 * elements. The code is very well commented so that you can see
 * what's happening at each step. The application uses one screen
 * and a some widgets to provide a password entry box and some
 * control buttons. For more advanced use of MAUI, see our MAUIEx
 * example application.
 *
 * NOTE: "MA" is short for MoSync API. "MAUI" stands for the MoSync
 * user interface API. This is a completely cross platform API that
 * works on a wide range of devices. There is also a native widget
 * API, also cross platform, but targeted for high-end devices,
 * currently Android and iPhone.
 *
 * This example application has the same functionality as our example
 * application "HelloNativeUI". Compare the two examples to see how we
 * do similar things in MAUI and in Native UI.
