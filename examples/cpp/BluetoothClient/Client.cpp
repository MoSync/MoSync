 * @file Client
 * @author Mikael Kindborg
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *  This program connects to a Bluetooth service
 *  with a specific UUID on a hardcoded address.
 *  It will then send character and touch input to
 *  that service.
 *
 * How to use:
 *
 *  See header comment in file Common.h
 *
 *  Note that the file Common.h is located in project
 *  BluetoothServer, and included into this file.
 *  It is assumed that both project folders BluetoothClient
 *  and BluetoothServer are located in the same directory.
 *
 * Further information:
 *
 *  This example shows the easiest way to connect to a
 *  Bluetooth server, using a connect method that takes
 *  a single url as its parameter:
 *
 *   int BluetoothConnection::connect(const char* url);
 *
 *  In our example the url contains the server address
 *  and a service UUID, for example:
 *
 *   btspp://0023769FD7C2:102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F010
 *
 *  Another (more advanced) option when connecting using a
 *  service UUID, is to use the connect methods that takes
 *  a MABtAddr and a MAUUID structure as parameters:
 *
 *   int BluetoothConnection::connect(
 *       const MABtAddr& address,
 *       const MAUUID& uuid);
 *
 *  When using this method, you need to fill in the data
 *  structures, and then pass them to the connect method.
 *  For example:
 *
 *   MABtAddr serverAddress =
 *       {{ 0x00,0x23,0x79,0x9F,0xD7,0xC2 }};
 *   MAUUID serviceUUID =
 *       {{ 0x10203040,0x50607080,0x90A0B0C0,0xD0E0F010 }};
 *   int result = mConnection.connect(serverAddress, serviceUUID);
