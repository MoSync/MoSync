/** \file main.cpp
* This applications demonstrates basic usage of the Moblet class.
* A Moblet is a class that wraps the standard procedural MoSync
* event system in a more OOP-style interface. Instead of implementing
* an event loop to recieve events, you implement a virtual function for
* each type of MoSync event. These include key events and close events.
*
* The static function Moblet::run() implements the actual event loop. In
* addition to providing a more object-oriented approach, using Moblets
* makes it easier to implement well-behaved MoSync programs. For instance,
* it will respond to close events by default.
