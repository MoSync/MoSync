 *
 * This application provides an example on how to use the Native UI.
 * It performs text searches on the Wikipedia, based on user input ( tags )
 * and selected categories. After searching for content that matches the given
 * tags, the user may select the desired article titles, and open  web views
 * to see the entire articles.
 * The application makes use of MoSync's Moblet framework to handle events.
 * On the first screen: HomeScreen, the user can provide some tags.
 * On the second screen: TitlesScreen, a list of available titles is displayed.
 * Each title can be checked/unchecked.
 * On the third screen: SummaryScreen, the snippets are displayed, for the
 * checked titles in the previous screen.
 * By clicking on each snippet, a Web view is shown in the WebScreen.
 * The application is exited by pressing the back button.
