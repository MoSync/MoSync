/** @file hellonativeui.cpp
*
* This application provides a very basic example of how to work with Native UI
* to position and and manipulate graphical user interface elements. The code is
* very well commented so that you can see what's happening at each step.
* The application uses one screen and a some widgets to provide a password
* entry box and some control buttons.
*
* NOTE: this example application has the same functionality as our example
* application "HelloMAUI". Compare the two examples to see how we do the same
* things in MAUI and in Native UI.
