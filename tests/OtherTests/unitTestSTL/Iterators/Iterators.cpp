/**
*  An iterator is an object that can iterate through a range, pointing to the elements in the range.
*  An iterator has to provide at least operator++, to iterate forward the range. Also it has to
*  provide the dereference operator(*), so that we can access the object
*  to which it points.
*  All containers define their own iterators, which have different abilities.
*  Depending on the the abilities they have, iterators are classified in five categories:
*  		-> Input iterators
*  		-> Output iterators
*  		-> Forward iterators
*  		-> Bidirectional iterators
*  		-> Random access iterators.
