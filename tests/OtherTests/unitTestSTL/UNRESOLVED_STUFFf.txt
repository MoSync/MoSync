1) can't include the <map> header yet. Have to check "Ignore default" and include 
all the paths manually (paths to headers).

2) map not covered yet!

3) make/ test library also in release

4) mem_fun and allocators not covered yet.

5) The library is not as easy to use as MAUtil.lib for example, were you have to 
include only the library at BuildSettings. For stlport.lib you have to add also the
path to the headers (Mosync/include/stlport). Have to make it user friendly, like MAUtil.

6) iostreams, locals not included in the library. Should I include them later?
