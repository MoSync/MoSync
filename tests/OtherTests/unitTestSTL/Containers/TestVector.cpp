/**
 * Function for testing the STL vector container.
 * std::vector keeps its elements in a dynamic array and maintains its storage as a single contiguous
 * array of objects (in order to have efficient indexing and iteration). A dynamic array is allocated
 * first time the vector is constructed. When vector needs a bigger array, to hold its elements,
 * it will allocate a new, bigger, chunk of memory and will copy all the elements to this new chunk, deleting the
 * old chunk and destroying the objects contained in it.
 * std::vector provides (the fastest) random access to its elements. It has a random access iterator. That means that we can
 * iterate through a vector step by step, using the ++ operator and --operator. And also we can move the iterator more then a step,
 * and have access to random positions like this:
 * 				++myVectorIterator; 	//ok. Move one step forward
 * 				--myVectorIterator; 	//ok. Move one step backward
 * 				myVectorIterator + 5; 	//ok. Move the iterator 5 positions forward.
 * 				myVectorIterator - 2	//ok
 * Has the fastest access speed of all STL containers. Also has the fastest iterators.
 * Appending and removing elements at the end of the container is very fast. Inserting an element
 * at the middle or at the beginning, means that all the following elements have to be moved to make room
 * for the new element, so it can take time.
 * std::vector is guaranteed to have the lowest space overhead per contained object
 * of all the STL containers(zero bytes).
 * It is the only STL container that guarantees that two object near each other in container,
 * will be near each other in memory.
 * The vector container is defined in <vector> header.
