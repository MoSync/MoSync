/**
 *  stack is a container that operates as in a LIFO (last in first out) mode.
 *  The elements are inserted and extracted only from the end of the container.
 *  std::stack is implemented as a container adaptor. Containers adapters are classes that use an
 *  encapsulated container and provide a restricted interface to that container.
 *  The underlying container can be a STL container or some other  container type. It has to provide the
 *  following public member functions: back(), push_back(), pop_back().
 *  stack is defined as a template taking two parameters:
 *  		template < 	class T,
 *  					class Container = deque<T>
 *  				>
 *  				class stack;
 * 		The first parameter is the type of elements in will contain.
 * 		The second parameter is the underlying container, and is by default std::deque.
 * std::stack is defined in the <stack> header.
