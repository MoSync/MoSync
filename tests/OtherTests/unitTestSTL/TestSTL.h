	 * std::set accepts only one copy of an object. So it's guaranteed that a set will hold unique values. If you try to insert
	 * an object that is equivalent to one that is already in the set, the set won't make the insertion.
	 * std::set has bidirectional iterators. We can advance with ++ and -- operators, but we can't move more than one step.
	 * That means that we can write for example:
	 * 				++mySetIterator; 	//ok. Move one step forward
	 * 				--mySetIterator; 	//ok. Move one step backward
	 * 				mySetIterator + 5; 	//not ok. It won't compile. Only random access iterators can move more then a step...
